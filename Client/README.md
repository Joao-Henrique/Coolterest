# Coolterest

## - Project description

+ The Coolterest is a Pinterest clone. It's a Full Stack Aplication made for [FreeCodeCamp's](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) BackEnd Certification

+ This project uses the MERN stack - Mongo DB, Express.js, React and Node.js.

+ I've used create-react-app to initialize the project.

+ I will be using a library called Mansonry.js that allows for Pinterest-style image grids.

+ The project will be deployed in Heroku.

## - Functionality

+ As an unauthenticated user, I can login with Twitter.

+ As an authenticated user, I can link to images.

+ As an authenticated user, I can delete images that I've linked to.

+ As an authenticated user, I can see a Pinterest-style wall of all the images I've linked to.

+ As an unauthenticated user, I can browse other users' walls of images.

+ As an authenticated user, if I upload an image that is broken, it will be replaced by a placeholder image. (can use jQuery broken image detection)
